# Coding Example
This is a coding example project for an interview.

The app itself is simplistic, but shows a command of the full stack as well as
devops technologies.

## Stack
The technologies used are: React, Express, Node, MongoDB.

The App provides a form, that upon submission, saves the data inside to the
mongoDB database.

## CI is built through travis-ci
Simple unit and integration tests are ran for both the server and the client.
